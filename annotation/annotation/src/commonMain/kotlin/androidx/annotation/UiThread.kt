/**
 * Denotes that the annotated method or constructor should only be called on the UI thread.
 * If the annotated element is a class, then all methods in the class should be called
 * on the UI thread.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * @UiThread
 * public abstract void setText(@NonNull String text) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** Ordinarily, an app's UI thread is also the main
 * thread. However, under special circumstances, an app's UI thread
 * might not be its main thread; for more information, see
 * [Thread annotations](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#thread-annotations).
